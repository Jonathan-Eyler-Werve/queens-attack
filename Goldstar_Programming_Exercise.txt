* Javascript Programming Exercise

  You are to write a solution to the "Queen's Attack" problem.

  The program should present an HTML form that represents a standard
  8x8 chess board.  Having selected two positions on the board, the
  program will report whether chess queens in those positions can
  attack one another.

  In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces that are on the same
  row, column, or diagonal.


** Requirements

   Provide your solution via email in a tarball, zipfile, or other
   standard format.

   You are free to use Internet resources, such as tutorials and API
   documentation, but not to post questions about how to solve the
   problem.  The solution should be written by you without outside
   help.

   Please provide, along with your solution, anything required for
   running your program, e.g., instructions for running it, build
   instructions, README files, tests, etc.

   Your solution will be judged on:

     - providing a complete and correct solution
     - clarity and conciseness of code
     - completeness and usefulness of accompanying artifacts

   If you do not understand something or believe there is an ambiguity
   in the instructions, please get in touch with your questions.
